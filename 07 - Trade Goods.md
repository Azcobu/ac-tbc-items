- trade goods (class = 7)
  - parts (subclass = 1): >=60 looks good - lowest vanilla is 58, arcanite converter
  - explosives (subclass = 2): 1 level 60 vanilla bomb, 19831 arcane bomb. >= 60 is good otherwise though. Maybe just >= 61 and add the 1 TBC 60 item which is 23736 fel iron bomb
  - devices (subclass = 3): >= 61 + "battered steam tonk controller". There are devices (field repair bot 74a) that are ilvl 60 in classic. There are 2 TBC toys that are 60 as well (crashin' thrashin' robot and racer controller)
  - jewelcrafting (subclass = 4): >= 60 is fine - only 12 items affected, most of which are deprecated anyway.
  - cloth (subclass = 5) : ilvl >= 60, 11 items or 18 counting wrath items too
  - leather (subclass = 6): ths one is really mixed - lots of TBC leather at 60, but lots of vanilla raid leather there too. >=61 + the following - 29539 cobra scales, 25708 thick clefthoof leather, nether dragonscales, fel scales, wind scales, crystal infused leather, knothide leather scraps.)
  - metal and stone (subclass = 7) - CANNOT use >=60 as breakpoint, there are vanilla metal/stone drops that are ilvl 60 -  query needs to be >= 61 + felsteel bar, fel iron bar, fel iron ore
  - meat (subclass = 8): >= 60 seems to be fine with 1 exception, 21024 Chimaerok Tenderloin in Feralas is 60
  - herbs (subclass = 9): there are 2 ilvl 60 classic herbs, black lotus and bloodvine, and blood scythe (a tool) . >= 61 is fine + 22789 terocone, 22786 dreaming glory, 22785 felweed
  - elemental (subclass = 10): >= 60 is fne, nice clear divide for once
  - other (subclass = 11): lots of overlap. >=61 is fine, but needs to add soul essence, inscribed scrollcase, curious crate, Charged Draenethyst Crystal which are all 60
  - enchanting (subclass = 12): >= 60 is fine except for 1 overlap, 20725 nexus crystals
